## Asynchronous Queries

Async query supports users to execute queries asynchronously, and provides a more efficient way to export the query results. 
For instance, if the result set of a query is extremely large (million-scale), async queries could help you to export the result set effortlessly.

Currently, through REST API is the only way to execute async queries, and please read [Async Query API](../rest/async_query_api.en.md) for the detailed information about how to use async query.
