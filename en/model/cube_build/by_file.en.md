## Build by File

In Kyligence Enterprise, data can be built into cube incrementally from new data files if the underlying model is defined with incremeantal data loading "by file". Currently we only support submit a cube build job via REST API.

For more details about how to submit a cube build job for loading new data from files, please refer to REST API chapters.
