## Introduction

The function of Auto-Modeling has been supported since KAP 3.0. The system will create models automatically on the basis of the SQLs imported. Also it is feasible to accelerate history query, which helps improve your efficiency of building models and executing query.

It takes four steps to accomplish Auto-Modeling:

- [Query Input](query_input.en.md)
- [Pattern Recognition](pattern_recognition.en.md)


- [Auto Modeling](auto_modeling.en.md)


- [Query Accelerator](query_accelerator.en.md)
