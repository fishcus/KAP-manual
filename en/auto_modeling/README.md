## Introduction

Auto-Modeling has been supported since Kyligence Enterprise 3.0. The system will create models automatically based on SQL statements. It is very useful to accelerate historical queires, which greatly improves efficiency of model building and query execution.

It takes four steps to accomplish Auto-Modeling:

- Query Input
- Pattern Recognition
- Auto Modeling
- Query Accelerator


> Notice: Data source Kafka is not supported in Auto-Modeling.
