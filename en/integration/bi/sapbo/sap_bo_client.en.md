   Modify the DSN to the required DSN and save it

### FAQ

**Q:Queries generated by BO will be accompanied by database name, including the default database, and the default is a key word in  Kyligence Enterprise that cannot use the form of "default.table".**

Please set `kylin.query.escape-default-keyword` to true in **kylin.properties**, and Kyligence Enterprise will automatically convert default to "DEFAULT".
