## Install KAP

### Deployment Architecture

In general KAP deployed on a single node can serve small-scale (QPS<50) query and deployment process is easy and quick. The architecture of this deployment is shown in the following figure.

Please take care of following configurations in Single Node Deployment especially deployed in Sandbox. `yarn.nodemanager.resource.cpu-vcores` relates to CPU resources, and others are memory related configurations. Please refer to [Hadoop official site](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.3/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/yarn-default.xml) for detailed info.

- yarn.nodemanager.resource.cpu-vcores

- yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb

- yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb

- mapreduce.map.memory.mb

- mapreduce.reduce.memory.mb

- mapreduce.map.java.opts

- mapreduce.reduce.java.opts

### Install KAP

To obtain KAP package, please refer to [KAP release notes](../release/README.md). There may have some minor differences between KAP and KAP plus. 

Copy KAP binary package into the server mentioned above, and unpack to /usr/local

```shell
cd /usr/local
tar -zxvf kap-{version}-{hbase}.tar.gz
```

Set environment variable `KYLIN_HOME` to the KAP extracted directory.

```shell
export KYLIN_HOME=/usr/local/kap-{version}-{hbase}
```

Prepare a working directory on HDFS for KAP user. The directory is `/kylin` by default and is configurable in `conf/kylin.properties`.

```shell
hdfs dfs -mkdir /kylin
# and grant permission to the user who will run KAP process
hdfs dfs -mkdir /kylin/root
```
If no write permission on HDFS, please switch to hdfs account first, create the directory, and grant the privileges. 

```shell
su hdfs
hdfs dfs -mkdir /kylin
hdfs dfs -chown root /kylin
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/root
hdfs dfs -chown root /user/root
```

> KAP Plus will start Spark Executor, so need more YARN resource. For sandbox testing, please lower the Executor resource. Append (or update) the following parameters to `conf/kylin.properties`
>
> kap.storage.columnar.conf.spark.driver.memory=512m
> kap.storage.columnar.conf.spark.executor.memory=512m
> kap.storage.columnar.conf.spark.executor.cores=1
> kap.storage.columnar.conf.spark.executor.instances=1
>
> Or run `bin/setup.sh` to setup the Spark Executor related parameters.

### Environment Check

Make sure the user that runs KAP has permissions to access Hadoop services. If not sure, please run script `check-env.sh` to have a check. Errors will be printed to the console by this script if there is any misconfiguration.

```shell
${KYLIN_HOME}/bin/check-env.sh
```

> Optionally, if want to install multiple KAP instances in a Hadoop cluster, you must specify different metadata URL for each instance. In `conf/kylin.properties`, set `kylin.metadata.url` to different values for each instance, for example `kylin_default_instance@hbase` (the default value), or `kylin_prod@hbase`, or `kylin_qa@hbase` etc.

If environment check hits error, most likely it is because certain Hadoop dependency is not detected automatically. To overcome, you can specify Hadoop dependencies explicitly by setting environment variables, including `HADOOP_CONF_DIR`, `HIVE_LIB`, `HIVE_CONF`, and `HCAT_HOME`. Examples:

```shell
export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/etc/hadoop/conf
export HIVE_LIB=/usr/lib/hive
export HIVE_CONF=/etc/hive/conf
export HCAT_HOME=/usr/lib/hive-hcatalog
```

If you want to deploy Kerberos, please refer to [Kerberos](../security/kerberos.en.md).

### Start KAP

Execute command `bin/kylin.sh start`, KAP will start in background. You can track starting progress by watching file `logs/kylin.log` with `tail` command.

```shell
${KYLIN_HOME}/bin/kylin.sh start
```

To confirm KAP is running, check the process by `ps -ef | grep kylin`.

> If hit problem, please confirm all KAP processes are stopped before restart. See "Stop KAP" section for details.

### Open KAP GUI

After starting KAP, open browser and visit KAP website `http://<host_name>:7070/kylin`. KAP login page shows if everything is good(**User**:ADMIN/**PW**: KYLIN). Once you login the web page via default user/password, GUI would lead you to reset the password follow the password rules.

> **Password rules:**
>
> It should be at least 8 bytes.
>
> It should have at least one number/ one letter/ one special characters(~!@#$%^&*(){}|:"<>?[];',./`).

Please replace `host_name` to machine name, ip address or domain name. The default KAP website port is 7070.

Once login to KAP successfully, you can validate the installation by building a sample cube. Please continue to [Install Validation](install_validate.en.md).

### Stop KAP
Execute command `bin/kylin.sh stop` to stop KAP service.

Confirm KAP process is stopped, `ps -ef | grep kylin` should return nothing.
