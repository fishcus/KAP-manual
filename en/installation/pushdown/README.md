## Query Pushdown

Kyligence Enterprise integrates a Smart Pushdown engine which works with multiple SQL on Hadoop engines like Hive, SparkSQL and Impala, and also traditional RDBMS/DW like Greenplum, Netezza and SQL Server. 

For queries which cannot be answered by Kyligence Enterprise, they can be routed into Pushdown Query Engine when necessary.
