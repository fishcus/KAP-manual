## Kyligence Enterprise 3.1 Release Note

We're happy to announce the GA of Kyligence Enterprise 3.1.0. In this new release, we support **MySQL** as data source to offload its analytical workloads. We simplified the deployment of **R/W separation** and implemented a **more flexible authorization control** at all data granularity. For application deployment or migration between Kyligence systems, we added **import/export function** of project metadata. 

### **New Read/Write Separation Architecture and Deployment**

With more rational design, we simplified the deployment process of R/W separation, to achieve a more stable system via separating workloads between query and cube data loading on different Hadoop clusters.

### **Flexible Data Access Authorization**

Supporting explicit / implicit granting access to data tables, as well as more powerful REST APIs, we enable much more flexible and secure data access control at all granularities for enterprise applications.

### **Export / Import Metadata by Projects**

For more convenient and efficient deployment / migration of Kyligence applications between clusters, we support export / import metadata by projects.
