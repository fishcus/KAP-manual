+ Support Gbase data source docking on FI cluster.

#### Bug Fix

+ No information is returned after the cache API is executed

+ The table schema in the subquery is not completed

+ Kyligence Enterprise services can still be used when the test license expires

+ The SQL statement contains double quote, and an error will be reported when the query is pressed to SparkSQL

### Kyligence Enterprise 3.4.5.2113 {#2113}

#### Enhancement

+ The Spark block cleanup mechanism is introduced in this version, which improves the query stability of Kyligence Enterprise. However, because the time to clean up the block is included in the query time, it may cause a certain decrease in query performance, and the impact on small queries may be more obvious than large queries.

+ When the datatype of dimension is decimal(x,0) and its value in the query is equal to a decimal, queries which hit Cube may not get the result 

#### Bug Fix

+ The task status corresponding to asynchronous query is not synchronized between nodes in time, resulting in non-executing nodes not being able to obtain corresponding information

+ After Sum(expression) is turned on, the result of the queries which contain sum(cast(case when)) may be incorrect.

+ In the MapR platform, when running upgrade.sh file, queries may get error because spark-core.jar was not replaced correctly

+ If the version of Spark is replaced to a lower one, in the service status displayed on the web UI, when the system can execute the query that hits the Cube normally, the Spark cluster availability is still displayed as error
