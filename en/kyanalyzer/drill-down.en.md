## Drill-down and Roll-up

In the project of *learn_kylin*, the cube *kylin_sales_cube* contains the hierarchy as below. We will demonstrate how to perform the actions of drill-down and roll-up by taking the *kylin_sales_cube* as an example.

### Drill-down

#### Drill-down without filter

1. To drill down, first place one dimension of the hierarchy and a measure on a report. 

2. Click on the dimension and choose **Include Level**.

#### Drill-down with filter

You may also choose to drill down with the filter applied. The report will filter on the value of the dimension you selected.

1. To drill down, first place one dimension of the hierarchy and a measure on a report. 

2. Click on the dimension and choose **Keep and Include Level**.

3. Choose the dimension that you want to drill down to.

4. The report will return with the dimension that you choose to drill down to. 

In this example, by clicking on the value **Computers/Tablets & Networking** to trigger the filter, the drill-down with the filter will drill down with "Computers/Tablets & Networking" value only.

### Roll-up

You may also be able to roll up the dimension that you drilled down.

1. To roll up, first the hierarchy dimension that can be rolled up needs to be on the report.

2. Click on the dimension that you may want to roll up and choose **Remove Level**.

3. Choose the dimension that you want to roll up.
