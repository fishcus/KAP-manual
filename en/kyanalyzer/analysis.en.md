## Filtering, Sorting, Ranking and Totaling 

In this section, we will introduce several report functions you may perform in KyAnalyzer:

### Filtering

To filter the query results, you may click the dimension name, and then a filter dialog will pop up. Input the pattern in the **Search** box to narrow your selection, and then check the data options to be filtered. You can filter the options with the modes of Include or Exclude.

### Totaling

You may calculate subtotals and grand totals at different dimension levels.

#### Subtotal
