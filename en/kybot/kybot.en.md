#### 2. How to obscure sensitive information

- OBF=obfuscate RAW=none obfuscate
- Mail account is obfuscated by default while cardinality is not (If cardinality OBF set, obfuscated range: tiny: <20; small: <100; medium: <1000; high: <10,000; very high: <100,000; ultra high: >=100,000).
- If hostname defaults to be OBF, then the mode of hostname needs to be defined: such as kybot.obf.hostname.pattern=\*.kybot.io
